XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It serves as a means to store and transport data. It is easily readable by humans and machines.

URI - Uniform Resource Identifier - identifies the name of a resource.

URN - Uniform Resource Name - A URI which identifies the name of a resource within a namespace.

URL - Uniform Resource Locator - A URI which identifies a web resource.

An XML namespace is an abstract domain to which a collection of element and attribute names can be assigned. 
The name of the namespace itself is not strictly defined.
Even if some names might start with 'http:' they don't have anything to do with the specified URL address.
